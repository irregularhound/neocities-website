                            attention span with most websites. The ones linked below are the accounts I tend to
                            prioritize.</p>

                            <h2><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/167098539-wildcat">Goodreads</a></h2>
                            <p>I personally prefer Storygraph, but alas,
                                Goodreads is what everyone else uses to keep track of their reading progress. So as someone
                                who wants to read, I have no real choice in the matter.</p>

                            <p>This website gave me motivation to work on watching movies again. I'm serious. It challenges me to have something to say about a movie once I watch, and to analyze it on a five star scale.</p>

                            <h2><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/vintagecivet">StoryGraph</a></h2>
                            <p>My preferred place to update my reading progress. That being said, I am still a really slow reader, and it's kind of embarassing at this point. I also like the UI better, it's less cluttered.</p>

                            <p>I never expected myself to be a fan of organizing images but here we are. Anyways, I'm usually on here to make aesthetic boards for my characters and stories.</p>

                            <p>I've been using Tumblr since 2015, and that's not going to change anytime soon. If you want to reach out to me privately, your best bet is to message me here.</p>

                            <p>I tend to blog about my characters, as I am rather fixated on them. That being said, the most I do on there is tag them in posts I think fit them. Sometimes I post art and musings about them as well.</p>

                            <p>This is where I keep all of my actual writing and prose. There's not much on it so far, because I haven't made a lot of short stories I feel are actually worth publishing.</p>
