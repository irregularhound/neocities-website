                        <p>This story was a long time coming. I've had a special interest in WWI since I
                            saw 1917 in 2019, so writing a WWI-centric story was sort of invetiable.</p>
                        <p>As with most of my stories, the idea stemmed from me fleshing out a character. In Frederick's
                            case, I developed him for a WWI/WWII OC server I was in at the time so I could interact with
                            other people. However, doing research for his backstory and looking into the history of
                            Indigenous Americans in the military during this time period caught my attention more. My
                            desire to tell this fictional man's story is also rooted in my interest in the history of
                            the military service of non-white men. (This is something I am particularly interested in
                            with thanks to my grandfather's service.)</p>
                        <p>To this day, I'm still struggling to make the story as accurate and sensitive as possible
                            within my limits. It's been an intersting challenge so far.</p>
