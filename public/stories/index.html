                                                    in. Unable to handle the disappointing banalities of his

                                                    actions become difficult to ignore. Soon, he must confront the

                                                <p>Sasha is a reclusive history major with a fascination for the
                                                    macabre. Growing up in a conservative small town, she found solace
                                                    in the digital world, where her interests in taboo topics
                                                    flourished. Sasha's journey is ultimately an exploration of
                                                    isolation, political radicalization, and the struggle to find
                                                    connection in a world that often feels hostile and alien.</p>
