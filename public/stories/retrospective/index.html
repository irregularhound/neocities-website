                                                        Conrad Dean Mallory can only be described as an awful man.
                                                        Controlling, manipulative, emotionally unstable, self-loathing,
                                                        bitter, pathetic, and above all, dangerous. Deep down, he knows
                                                        he will never be that strong figure he saw his father as growing
                                                        up. Even with reaping the benefits of being a middle class white
                                                        man in suburbia with a dutiful wife and two kids, he still feels
                                                        suffocated by his current lifestyle, especially with his
                                                        mediocre white collar job. Though he always saw himself as
                                                        the dignified wolf hunting deer like he does in the woods, he is
                                                        really more of a cat toying with its prey and leaving it to
                                                        suffer afterwards.</p>

                                                        of being a part of the Mallory household by playing wife and

                                                        She is known for her unusually cold, blunt attitude; very few

                            <p>"Promise you won't leave me. I still need you in my life."</p>
                            <p>His blood ran cold at his mother's words. They weren't meant for him, they were meant for
